Project Overview
This project focuses on developing and implementing algorithms for weather monitoring using cellular data. Cellular network data serves as opportunistic data for environmental sensing, where signal attenuation can be used to detect and estimate weather conditions.

The main goal is to filter and identify relevant weather phenomena from noisy and unstructured data by combining signal processing techniques with machine learning (ML) models. A key challenge is isolating the desired effect from background noise, which we address by integrating ML algorithms with physical insights to improve spatial field estimation.

The project specifically targets rainfall detection and estimation by analyzing the attenuation of cellular signals and its temporal evolution. Using cellular network data from Sweden, which includes signal attenuation and other relevant features, we implemented algorithms for rainfall detection and estimation. By intelligently combining these methods, as detailed in the Design section, we derived the final rainfall estimation.
